## HandArch Architecture

This repository contains the HandArch architecture for sign language hand pose recognition.

This architecture was presented and publish in the proceedings of **Workshop on computer vision (WVC) 2021** with the title:

"HandArch: A deep learning architecture for LIBRAS hand configuration recognition"

> :star: Conference BEST paper award.

The presentation can be viewed in [WVC's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8EO7pQV13o)


> :warning: **This repository is not yet functional, 
it contains the bare minimum code to create a sign 
language recognition system and lacks some methods.
We are working to finish this repository with installation/running requirements and sample code to demosntrate usage.**


## LIBRAS91 and Tracking dataset

We are still working in a way to make the datasets available. IF you want the datasets, please, send me an [e-mail](gabriel.carvalho@ufabc.edu.br)
with title "LIBRAS91 Dataset request" and I will send a link to download it.
